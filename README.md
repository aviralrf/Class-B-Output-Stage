File consists of a class B output stage design on LTSpice 
• Designed a switching mode class B output stage using both BJT and MOS technology and compared results

• DC characterisitics , waveforms for large signal at input , effect of load resistance on output waveform

• Reduction in Crossover Distortion using a high gain amplifier for feedback

• Harmonic Distortion due to increase in frequency and input voltage peak

• Tradeoff between Harmonic distortion , Efficiency and Power Dissipation was observed
